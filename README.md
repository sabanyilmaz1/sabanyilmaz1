Hi !

My name is Saban Yilmaz, I am an engineering student at the ENSC in Bordeaux, France. My field of study is cognitive sciences, which leads me to conduct computer science projects of different types (AI, web programming, object-oriented programming, ...).

My main programming languages are C#, Python and JavaScript (React, ReactNative, Node.js). But I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.

I also make mock-ups with Figma, in order to have good skills in UX design and human system interface.
